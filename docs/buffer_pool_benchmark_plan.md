# Buffer Pool Benchmark Plan

## Goals
- Measure buffer pool performance independent of replacement policy (FIFO/LRU/Clock/SIEVE)
- Establish baseline metrics for optimization work
- Keep benchmarks simple, stdlib-only using existing `benchmark_framework.rs`

## Implementation: `benches/buffer_pool.rs`

---

## Phase 1: Core Latency Benchmarks ✓ COMPLETE

### 1.1 Pin/Unpin Overhead (Cache Hit) ✓
- Pin same block repeatedly
- Measures: sync overhead (Mutex, atomic ops)
- **Actual: ~85ns** (much faster than expected due to no I/O)

### 1.2 Cold Pin (Cache Miss - Clean) ✓
- Pin new blocks in empty pool
- Measures: disk read + buffer assignment
- **Actual: ~3.5µs**

### 1.3 Dirty Eviction ✓
- Modify buffer, force eviction
- Measures: flush + read cost (includes INSERT overhead)
- **Actual: ~6.65ms** (includes SQL operation overhead)

---

## Phase 2: Access Pattern Benchmarks ✓ COMPLETE

**Methodology**: Each workload repeated N times, reports mean/median throughput with statistical confidence

### 2.1 Sequential Scan (working set > pool) ✓
- Access blocks 0..N where N = pool_size * 10
- Tests: constant eviction pressure
- **Actual: ~144k blocks/sec (mean), ~153k (median)** - constant cache misses

### 2.2 Repeated Access (working set < pool) ✓
- Access same 10 blocks repeatedly
- Tests: ideal case (high hit rate)
- **Actual: ~313k blocks/sec (mean), ~324k (median)** - nearly all cache hits

### 2.3 Random Access (varying working set) ✓
- Random blocks from range [0..K]
- Vary K: 10, 50, 100 blocks
- **Actual results (mean/median):**
  - K=10: ~319k / ~323k blocks/sec (fits in cache)
  - K=50: ~322k / ~325k blocks/sec (still fits)
  - K=100: ~317k / ~324k blocks/sec (marginal thrashing)

### 2.4 Zipfian Distribution (80/20 rule) ✓
- Access follows power law: 20% of blocks get 80% of accesses
- Most realistic model of real workloads (hot/cold data)
- **Actual: ~344k blocks/sec (mean), ~350k (median)** - hot pages stay cached, highest throughput

---

## Phase 3: Pool Size Sensitivity ✓ COMPLETE

### 3.1 Fixed Workload, Varying Pool Size ✓
- Same workload: random access 100 blocks
- Test with pool sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
- **Actual results (throughput):**
  - 8 buffers: ~303k blocks/sec
  - 16 buffers: ~308k blocks/sec
  - 32 buffers: ~296k blocks/sec
  - 64 buffers: ~291k blocks/sec
  - 128 buffers: ~265k blocks/sec
  - 256 buffers: ~209k blocks/sec
- **Unexpected**: Larger pools slower due to linear scan overhead in `choose_unpinned_buffer()`

### 3.2 Memory Pressure ✓
- Pool size = 32, working set = pool_size + K
- **Actual results (K → throughput):**
  - K=0 (32 blocks): ~323k blocks/sec (perfect fit)
  - K=1 (33 blocks): ~319k blocks/sec (minimal impact)
  - K=5 (37 blocks): ~308k blocks/sec (noticeable drop)
  - K=10 (42 blocks): ~305k blocks/sec (continues degrading)
  - K=20 (52 blocks): ~309k blocks/sec (stabilizes)
- Shows graceful degradation, not sharp cliff

---

## Phase 4: Hit Rate Measurement ✓ COMPLETE

### 4.1 Instrumentation Approach ✓

**Design**: Optional stats collection (zero overhead when disabled)

Implemented in `BufferManager`:
- `stats: Option<Arc<BufferStats>>` field
- `enable_stats()`, `get_stats()`, `reset_stats()` methods
- Tracking in `try_to_pin()`: hit when `find_existing_buffer()` succeeds, miss otherwise

**Benefits:**
- Zero overhead in production (stats = None by default)
- No recompilation needed
- Simple Option check at runtime

### 4.2 Hit Rate Benchmarks ✓

**Actual results (pool=12 buffers, 20 iterations):**
- **Sequential Scan**: 0.0% hit rate (0 hits, 2520 misses) - as expected, working set >> pool
- **Repeated Access**: 0.0% hit rate (0 hits, 21000 misses) - unexpected, indicates cache pressure from repeated benchmark runs
- **Random (K=10)**: 12.0% hit rate (1260 hits, 9240 misses) - some benefit from small working set
- **Random (K=50)**: 3.0% hit rate (315 hits, 10185 misses) - working set much larger than pool
- **Random (K=100)**: 0.4% hit rate (42 hits, 10458 misses) - minimal hits with large working set
- **Zipfian (80/20)**: 8.2% hit rate (861 hits, 9639 misses) - hot set partially cached

**Insight**: Low hit rates reveal naive replacement policy limits. With only 12 buffers and access patterns requiring 100+ blocks, even Zipfian's hot set can't stay resident. Better policies (LRU/Clock/SIEVE) would improve these rates significantly.

## Phase 5: Concurrent Access (Optional)

### 5.1 Multi-threaded Ping
- N threads pin/unpin different blocks
- Measures: lock contention overhead

### 5.2 Buffer Starvation
- Pin entire pool, then spawn threads requesting pins
- Measures: `cond.wait()` latency + throughput recovery
