# Buffer Pool Thrashing: Root Cause Analysis

## Summary

The current buffer pool implementation exhibits **pathological thrashing** where a single buffer is repeatedly reused even when multiple buffers are available. This causes 0% cache hit rates despite having sufficient buffer capacity (12 buffers for 10 blocks).

## Problem Statement

### Observed Behavior
```
Working set: 10 blocks
Buffer pool: 12 buffers (20% spare capacity)
Expected hit rate: ~90% after warmup
Actual hit rate: 0%
Actual buffers used: 1 out of 12
```

### Benchmark Evidence

From `benches/buffer_pool.rs` Phase 4 results:
```
Repeated Access (10 blocks, 12 buffers):
- Hit rate: 0.0% (0 hits, 21000 misses)
- Throughput: 313k blocks/sec
```

This pattern repeats across Phase 2 as well, indicating systemic issue rather than benchmark artifact.

## Root Cause

### The Bug: First-Unpinned Selection

**Location**: `src/main.rs:10580-10595` (`choose_unpinned_buffer()`)

```rust
fn choose_unpinned_buffer(&self) -> Option<Arc<Mutex<Buffer>>> {
    for buffer in &self.buffer_pool {
        let buffer_guard = buffer.lock().unwrap();
        if !buffer_guard.is_pinned() {
            return Some(Arc::clone(buffer));  // ❌ Always returns FIRST unpinned
        }
    }
    None
}
```

### Execution Trace

Debug output reveals the pathological pattern:

```
Access repeatfile block 0:
  DEBUG find_existing: NOT FOUND - will be a MISS
  DEBUG choose_unpinned: Using empty buffer 0

Access repeatfile block 1:
  DEBUG find_existing: NOT FOUND - will be a MISS
  DEBUG choose_unpinned: Evicting buffer 0 (had repeatfile block 0)

Access repeatfile block 2:
  DEBUG find_existing: NOT FOUND - will be a MISS
  DEBUG choose_unpinned: Evicting buffer 0 (had repeatfile block 1)

...

Access repeatfile block 0 (SECOND TIME):
  DEBUG find_existing: NOT FOUND - will be a MISS
  DEBUG choose_unpinned: Evicting buffer 0 (had repeatfile block 9)
```

**Every single access uses buffer 0**, evicting the previous block!

### Why This Happens

1. **Initial state**: Buffer 0 is empty (or has stale block from previous test)
2. **Access pattern**: `pin(block_N) → unpin(block_N) → pin(block_N+1)`
3. **Critical flaw**: After unpinning, buffer 0 is immediately the "first unpinned buffer"
4. **Result**: `choose_unpinned_buffer()` always returns buffer 0
5. **Outcome**: Each new block overwrites the previous one in buffer 0

### Why Other Buffers Unused

Buffers 1-11 remain untouched because:
- They start empty (unpinned)
- Buffer 0 is found first in iteration
- Once buffer 0 is unpinned, it's always selected before others

The algorithm never progresses past buffer 0 in the search.

## Impact

### Performance Degradation

1. **100% I/O overhead**: Every access requires disk read
2. **Write amplification**: Dirty evictions trigger unnecessary flushes
3. **Wasted memory**: 91% of buffer pool (11/12 buffers) sits idle
4. **CPU waste**: Lock contention on single buffer

### Workloads Affected

- **Sequential scans with reuse**: Any pattern revisiting recent blocks
- **Index scans**: B-tree navigation frequently revisits internal nodes
- **Small working sets**: Most vulnerable (the smaller the set, the worse the thrashing)
- **OLTP workloads**: High locality patterns destroyed

## Solution: Replacement Policy

The fix requires implementing a proper replacement policy that considers access patterns rather than always selecting the first unpinned buffer.

### LRU (Least Recently Used)

**See**: [Issue #17](https://github.com/redixhumayun/simpledb/issues/17) for complete LRU implementation plan

Track access times and evict least recently used:

```rust
struct Buffer {
    // ... existing fields
    last_access: Instant,
}

fn choose_unpinned_buffer(&self) -> Option<Arc<Mutex<Buffer>>> {
    let mut oldest_buffer = None;
    let mut oldest_time = Instant::now();

    for buffer in &self.buffer_pool {
        let buffer_guard = buffer.lock().unwrap();
        if !buffer_guard.is_pinned() {
            if oldest_buffer.is_none() || buffer_guard.last_access < oldest_time {
                oldest_time = buffer_guard.last_access;
                oldest_buffer = Some(Arc::clone(buffer));
            }
        }
    }
    oldest_buffer
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Industry-standard algorithm
- Respects temporal locality
- Significantly improves hit rates
- Predictable behavior

### Alternative: Clock Algorithm

Clock algorithm is another option that approximates LRU with lower overhead. See database literature for implementation details.

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Test

After fix, `repeated_access` benchmark should show:

```
Working set: 10 blocks
Buffer pool: 12 buffers
Expected hit rate: ~90% (900 hits / 1000 accesses after warmup)
Expected buffers used: 10 out of 12
```

### Regression Test

Create dedicated test:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_no_single_buffer_thrashing() {
    let (db, _test_dir) = SimpleDB::new_for_test(4096, 12);
    let bm = db.buffer_manager();
    bm.enable_stats();

    // Access 10 different blocks twice each
    for round in 0..2 {
        for i in 0..10 {
            let block_id = BlockId::new("test".to_string(), i);
            let buffer = bm.pin(&block_id).unwrap();
            bm.unpin(buffer);
        }
    }

    let (hits, misses) = bm.get_stats().unwrap();

    // First 10 accesses are cold misses
    // Next 10 accesses should all hit (10 blocks fit in 12 buffers)
    assert_eq!(misses, 10, "First pass should miss");
    assert_eq!(hits, 10, "Second pass should hit (no thrashing!)");
}
```
